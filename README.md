### Introduction/Business Problem
A family with little child decided to move to another country. There have already chosen a city, but have a lot of doubts about neighbourhoods. They ask me to compare their previous home location with a new one. 
Here is the criteria list to consider, distance to/from:
- schools/kindergartens;
- parks/playground for children;
- gyms/swimming pools;
- supermarkets/grocery shops;
- train and bus stations;
- airport;
- restaurants;

In the future, anyone could use this model to find a similar district in another city or country.

I will use data from Foursquare to qualify and cluster neighbourhoods, based on distance and type. I will check other sources for crime and unemployment rates.
